"react-virtualized" uses UMD style loading to work in many different environments.
It assumes that "react", "react-addons-shallow-compare", and "react-dom" are all included
separately via require statements. The paths to our installations are different.

If upgrading, define the correct paths and replace the require statements for the
module.exports case with the correct paths.

Also, replace any references to React.addons.shallowCompare with the webpack module id.
